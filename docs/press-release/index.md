Press Release:

World premiere of physical theatre using an original bucky ball structure, dance, aerial, stage combat, and new music with songs.

LSU Physical Theatre Presents:

## [The Last Beginning](../)

When there is no one left but a handful of the human race, what keeps them going? Are we hardwired to self-destruct or can we find something that unites us all to survive and thrive? This production brings together dance, acrobatics, aerial silk, a new multi-person dance sphere, stage combat, original composition and innovative light-stick technology to create a new look at who we might become.

LSU Physical Theatre is committed to encouraging a view of global citizenry and cultural cross-pollination in the lives of young adults at home and abroad to foster a future of global inclusiveness and compassion.
