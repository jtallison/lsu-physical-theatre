LSU Physical Theatre Presents:

# The Last Beginning 

When there is no one left but a handful of the human race, what keeps them going? Are we hardwired to self-destruct or can we find something that unites us all to survive and thrive? This production brings together dance, acrobatics, aerial silk, a new multi-person dance sphere, stage combat, original composition and innovative light-stick technology to create a new look at who we might become.

LSU Physical Theatre is committed to encouraging a view of global citizenry and cultural cross-pollination in the lives of young adults at home and abroad to foster a future of global inclusiveness and compassion. 

LSU Theatre’s creative team consists of director, Nick Erickson, founding member of Diavolo: Architecture in Motion and a professional actor, director and choreographer of stage combat. Composer and Digital Media Artist, Jesse Allison, has been working in interactive video projection and responsive sound installations for over 20 years. Tyler Kieffer has 10 years of sound design in New York and beyond.  Author Vince LiCata has had several of his plays produced at the Fringe and in London. Olivia Lunsford, Chance Fillastre and Caitlin Church are debuting their professional compositions and songs with this production. Suzanne Chambliss has costume designed dozens of feature films and television shows in her career. 

“if you want to be amazed, terrified, and captivated. This show was unlike anything we had ever seen.” Byteback Theatre
